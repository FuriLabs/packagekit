The name of this backend is apt

It supports the Advanced Packaging Tool used by Debian and its derivates. The
implementation was done in Python. The communication between the daemon and
the backend process happens via stdin and stdout, it is a so called spawned
backend using a dispatcher to allow the execution of several commands in a row.

To provide a tremendously fast search function a Xapian database is used.
It is provided by Enrico Zini's apt-xapian-index. Debtags will be used to 
enhance the quality of the search results further.

A list of implemented functions are listed in the PackageKit FAQ:
