packagekit (0.6.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     - This is the first release of PackageKit to support session
       configuration helper support in the GLib and QT libraries.
     - This allows debconf to work when using PackageKit on Debian.
     - A formal transaction lifecyle is now in place, which allows future
       extensions to hook into the transaction at certain points.
